# Movie_Watchlist_Tracker

#  Overview of the Project
Movie Tracker CLI is a lightweight, command-line interface application designed to help movie enthusiasts keep a personal log of films they have watched. The program allows users to quickly input movie titles along with a personal rating, storing them in a temporary runtime list. It serves as an excellent foundational project for understanding Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.

#  Features
Interactive Menu: A clean, looping menu system that keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.

Add Movies: Users can input a custom movie title and assign a rating (0-10).

View Watchlist: Displays a formatted list of all movies added during the session with their corresponding scores.

Error Handling: Basic validation to handle invalid menu choices.

#  Technologies/Tools Used
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: Standard Python Library (No external installations required)

while loops for program flow

lists and dictionaries for data storage

input/output handling

f-strings for formatting
