# Problem Statement
Movie enthusiasts often struggle to keep track of the numerous films they watch. Relying on memory or scattered physical notes can lead to forgetting titles or personal ratings over time. There is a need for a simple, digital tool to quickly log movie titles and scores in an organized manner without the complexity of heavy software.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is limited to a Command Line Interface (CLI) application. It handles data input and retrieval within a single runtime session.

In Scope: Capturing user input (text and numbers), storing data in Python dictionaries/lists, and displaying formatted output.

Out of Scope: Permanent data storage (databases/files), graphical user interface (GUI), or fetching external movie metadata from the web.

# Target Users
Movie Buffs: Individuals who want a quick, no-nonsense way to list movies they have recently watched.

Python Beginners: Students or hobbyists looking for a practical example of how to implement while loops, lists, and dictionaries in a real-world context.

# High-level Features
Movie Logging: Allows the user to input a custom movie title and assign a specific numeric rating (0-10).

Watchlist Display: Aggregates all entered data into a readable "Watch List" format, showing titles alongside their ratings.

Menu Navigation: Features a continuous loop with a clear menu system, allowing users to add multiple entries without restarting the program.
